# DONOFF
Years ago I started building RF devices to measure temperatures and switching lights on or off. I even wrote a small 
book (in Dutch) about my findings and experiments. But I always wanted to overcome the main disadvantage of RF 
devices: no feedback about the status of the lights. I thought that could be done better and with the introduction 
of the small ESP8266 WiFi enabled processors it could! But SONOFF beat me with there WiFi enabled switches. One 
disadvantage of the SONOFF devices is the poor software. To make the switches usable you have to upload third 
party firmware and install a Home-Automation solution on an other computer to control the switches. Another 
disadvantage of the SONOFF switches is .. well they are switches (Switch On Off). So there is room for improvement!

Albeit: I introduce to you: [DONOFF](https://willem.aandewiel.nl/index.php/2018/12/03/donoff-wifi-enabled-light-dimmer/) (Dimmer On Off)!
